   - Considers chronic condition in scheduling

### Part 4: Architecture (60 seconds)
Show how the system works:
```
User Query ‚Üí Supervisor Agent ‚Üí Routes to:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Triage Agent (symptoms, urgency)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Booking Agent (appointments)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Reminder Agent (follow-ups)
     ‚Üì
  AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
     ‚Üì
  DynamoDB (Patient History)
```

### Part 5: Technical Highlights (30 seconds)
- **Strands Agents**: Multi-agent framework from AWS
- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI reasoning
- **DynamoDB**: Real patient data storage
- **Contextual Memory**: Agents remember patient history
- **Production-Ready**: Scalable AWS architecture

## ‚úÖ Feature Checklist

Test these features during your demo:

### UI Features
- [ ] Clean, modern healthcare interface loads
- [ ] Can switch between 5 different patients
- [ ] Chat interface works smoothly
- [ ] Quick action buttons function
- [ ] Statistics update correctly
- [ ] Local/AWS mode toggle works

### Agent Features
- [ ] **Triage**: Symptom analysis with urgency levels
- [ ] **Context**: Recalls patient allergies and conditions
- [ ] **Booking**: Offers appointment slots
- [ ] **Reminders**: Sets up follow-up notifications
- [ ] **Memory**: Remembers conversation history
- [ ] **Routing**: Supervisor correctly routes to specialized agents

### AWS Integration
- [ ] Bedrock API calls work (check for throttling)
- [ ] DynamoDB queries return patient data
- [ ] Multi-patient data properly isolated
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting During Demo

### Issue: Bedrock Throttling Error
**Symptom**: "Too many requests" or "ThrottlingException"  
**Solution**: 
- This is normal for on-demand usage
- Wait 30-60 seconds between queries
- UI shows graceful fallback to mock data
- Emphasize this is a demo limitation, not architecture issue

### Issue: Slow Response
**Symptom**: Agent takes 5-10 seconds to respond  
**Solution**:
- This is normal for Bedrock API calls
- Show the "thinking" indicator in UI
- Use this time to explain the architecture
- Highlight that production would use provisioned throughput

### Issue: UI Not Loading
**Symptom**: http://localhost:8501 not accessible  
**Solution**:
```bash
lsof -ti:8501 | xargs kill -9
cd /Users/ramaswamy/Documents/AWSOpenHack/hospital-multi-agent
./START_DEMO.sh
```

---

## üìä Metrics to Highlight

During your demo, point out:

1. **Patient Context**: "Notice how it remembers Emma has a Penicillin allergy"
2. **Urgency Assessment**: "The triage agent properly escalated the fever to 'Medium' urgency"
3. **Multi-Agent Routing**: "The supervisor routed this to the booking agent automatically"
4. **Memory**: "It recalls our previous conversation about symptoms"
5. **Real AWS**: "This is hitting live AWS Bedrock and DynamoDB, not mocked"

---

## üé® UI Features to Showcase

### Sidebar
- Patient selector with descriptive profiles
- Connection mode toggle (Local/AWS)
- Real-time statistics (query counts)
- Quick action buttons

### Chat Interface
- Modern, clean message bubbles
- User messages (blue) vs AI messages (white)
- Urgency badges (color-coded: High/Medium/Low)
- Thinking indicators
- Mock mode disclaimer (when backend unavailable)

### Sample Queries

## üöÄ Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| UI Load | < 2 seconds | Streamlit initialization |
| Patient Switch | Instant | Local state change |
| Query Processing | 5-15 seconds | Bedrock API + DynamoDB |
| Database Lookup | < 1 second | DynamoDB query |
| Error Recovery | Graceful | Falls back to mock data |

---

## üí° Pro Tips for Demo

1. **Pre-load the UI**: Have http://localhost:8501 open before presenting
2. **Test queries first**: Make sure Bedrock isn't throttled
3. **Have backup**: Mock mode works without AWS if needed
4. **Tell a story**: Use Emma Johnson's story throughout
5. **Show context**: Switch patients to show different contexts
6. **Emphasize architecture**: Multi-agent + memory is the innovation
7. **Be honest**: If throttling occurs, explain it's a demo limitation

## üìù Talking Points

### Problem Statement
> "Hospitals struggle with patient triage, appointment management, and maintaining context across interactions. Staff are overwhelmed, and patients need immediate, intelligent responses."

### Your Solution
> "I built a multi-agent AI system using AWS Bedrock and Strands that intelligently routes patient queries, maintains medical context, and provides 24/7 assistance."

### Technical Innovation
> "The system uses a supervisor agent to route queries to specialized agents‚Äîtriage, booking, and reminders‚Äîeach with access to patient history via DynamoDB and powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet."

### Business Value
> "This reduces staff workload, provides instant patient responses, maintains safety by recalling allergies, and scales effortlessly on AWS infrastructure."

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your demo is successful if you show:
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent routing in action
- ‚úÖ Contextual memory (allergies, conditions)
- ‚úÖ Real AWS integration (not just mocked)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture
- ‚úÖ Beautiful, functional UI

---

## üìû Emergency Contacts

If things go wrong:

1. **Restart Streamlit**: `./START_DEMO.sh`
2. **Check AWS**: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
3. **View logs**: Check terminal output
4. **Fallback**: Mock mode works without AWS

---

## üèÜ What Makes This Special

1. **True Multi-Agent**: Not just one LLM, but coordinated agents
2. **Real Context**: Pulls from actual DynamoDB patient records
3. **Production Framework**: Uses AWS Strands, not a toy demo
4. **Safety-First**: Recalls allergies and medical history
5. **Scalable**: Built on AWS serverless architecture
